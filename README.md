# codekata-login

## Description

Simple form to get JWT token by email and password with an ability to log out and delete a session via API call.

Made with AngularJS. I know it's dead, but I stumbled upon it in some projects in the past, so I thought I'll be able to finish the form within 1 hour, no more. I'll try remaking it with Vue on my free time.

## Install

Node is used just for building a local server.

```
npm install
npm start
```
